# CSCI160-CQ5
Mars: 
The loop in the code iterates through the character in the input, since the comparisons are constant in the code. The runtime complexity is O(n); The space complexity of the function is also O(n) it took n length of the input string 
Two Strings:
Let the length of s1 be n1 and s2 be n2 and through the recursion function it's going to itereate through everything so the runtime of this code will be O(n1*n2) which is equal to O(n^2) if both string has the same length n; Let n be the length of the string s1. Since variables such as s1 and s2 are all going to be constant when considering space, therefor, the space complexity of the code is going to be O(n)
